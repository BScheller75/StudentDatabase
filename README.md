  Ask how many new students will be added
  User is prompted to enter name and year for each student
  Student should have 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
  Students can enroll in courses, with each costing $600
  Student should be able to view balance and pay their tuition
  See status of student, their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance
